# Potato-Disease-Detection-using-Python-and-R:
One of the most significant challenges faced by farmers in India is the identification of diseases 
that affect their crops. This lack of knowledge often leads to misdiagnosis and incorrect 
treatments, resulting in reduced crop yield and quality. To address this issue, our model utilizes 
advanced deep learning techniques to accurately detect and classify potato diseases from images. 
By providing farmers with timely and accurate information, our model aims to empower them to 
take appropriate measures to protect their crops and improve yield. 

# Tech Stack : RStudio, TensorFlow, Keras, Categorial Multi Class Classification Model

# Dataset Instructions: 
Download your premium dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukaffimoin/potato-diseases-datasets
It contains 7 subgroups of diseases, miscellaneous and healthy potatoes..
Divide the dataset into training, validation and test directories.. choosing a valid divide ratio like 70:30 or 80:20

# Execution Instruction: 
Make sure to Download keras and tensorflow library, use latest verion of python and RStudio..
